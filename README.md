nom-ination
===========

Development of Gottanom


Here we see the wild nom-inators...elegant in design, absolutely pant-messingly epic in everything else. Yea, we who walk this valley of cheeseburgers know not of hunger, for we shall nom. And then nom once more. And when there is nothing left to nom, the ultimate nom shall appear before us, and there will be much rejoicing. If you have read this far you seriously must have nothing better to do. No, really. Why are you still here? Are these words of nom-dom so far beyond the comprehension of your spleen? DOES IT TICKLE YOUR EYEBALLS?!? Butter. The sugar-coated ketchup of life begs the question: are we capable of nomming the universe, or does it require us to digest it's glory in an explosion of fantastic taste?

OK seriously. Why are you reading this far. This is all utter nonsense. Begone, and fear no hunger.
